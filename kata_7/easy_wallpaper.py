John wants to decorate the walls of a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.

John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters.
The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters.
He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or
miscalculations, so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.

Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

Task
Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls
he must buy.

Example:
wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"
wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"
"""
import math


def wallpaper(l, w, h):
    rolls = {
        0: 'zero', 1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three', 4: 'four',
        5: 'five', 6: 'six', 7: 'seven', 8: 'eight', 9: 'nine',
        10: 'ten', 11: 'eleven', 12: 'twelve', 13: 'thirteen',
        14: 'fourteen', 15: 'fifteen', 16: 'sixteen',
        17: 'seventeen', 18: 'eighteen', 19: 'nineteen', 20: 'twenty'
    }

    return rolls.get(math.ceil(((l + w) * 2 * h) * 1.15 / 5.2)) if l * w * h > 0 else "zero"
